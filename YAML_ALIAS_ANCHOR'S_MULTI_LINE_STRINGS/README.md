# YAML: Aliases, Anchors, and Multiline Strings

## Aliases and Anchors
YAML supports anchors (`&`) and aliases (`*`) to reduce repetition by referencing values already defined. This ensures consistency and simplifies editing.

### Syntax
- **Anchor (`&`)**: Used to define a reusable block of data.
- **Alias (`*`)**: Refers to the data defined by the anchor.

### Example
```yaml
# Define data using an anchor
person1: &person
  name: John Doe
  age: 30
  city: Bangalore

# Refer to the same data using an alias
person2: *person
```

### Output
```yaml
person1:
  name: John Doe
  age: 30
  city: Bangalore

person2:
  name: John Doe
  age: 30
  city: Bangalore
```

#### Use Case
When the same data is reused multiple times, aliases and anchors minimize duplication and reduce errors during updates.

## Multiline Strings
YAML provides ways to write long strings across multiple lines using **literal** and **folded blocks**.

### Literal Block ( `|` )
Preserves the format of the multiline string exactly as written.

#### Syntax
```yaml
key: |
  Line 1
  Line 2
  Line 3
```

#### Output
```
Line 1
Line 2
Line 3
```

#### Use Case
For content like file data, scripts, or preformatted text where whitespace and line breaks are important.

---

### Folded Block ( `>` )
Collapses newlines into spaces while preserving empty lines.

#### Syntax
```yaml
key: >
  This is a folded block.
  It combines multiple lines into a single line,
  maintaining empty line separation.

  This is a new paragraph.
```

#### Output
```
This is a folded block. It combines multiple lines into a single line, maintaining empty line separation.

This is a new paragraph.
```

#### Use Case
For text where line breaks are unimportant but logical grouping (e.g., paragraphs) is preserved.

### Combining Aliases and Multiline Blocks
Aliases and anchors can also reference multiline strings:

```yaml
content: &data |
  Line 1
  Line 2

copy: *data
```

#### Output
```
content:
  Line 1
  Line 2

copy:
  Line 1
  Line 2
```
